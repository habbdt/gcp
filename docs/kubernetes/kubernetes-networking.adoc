=== Configuring Load Balancer

. External load balancer
.. Support both TCP and UDP protocol.
. Internal load balancer
.. Allows cluster access by services on the same network.
.. Create using `yaml` file.
.. Services must use the same network and region. 
.. Same protocol type must be used (TCP/UDP)

Options for exposing deployments,

. Load balancing - external IP for public access
. Cluster IP - Uses internal IP in the cluster
. Node port - Uses same port on every node

==== Enable Internal Load Balancer

https://github.com/BPalmerLA/GoogleKubernetes/blob/master/internal-lb.yaml

```
$ kubectl apply -f internal-lb.yaml
$ kubectl get svc
$ kubectl describe svc <lb>
```

=== GKE Create Private Cluster

. Private cluster master node is publicly inaccessible. 
. Relies on VPC native range. 
. Private cluster must use the container registry image. 

==== Create Private Cluster 

. New cluster --> Advanced 
.. VPC-native [Enable VPC-native (using alias IP)]
.. Network Security --> Private cluster
... Access master using its external IP address --> Master IP range
.. Master authorized networks --> enable
... Add authorized network
.... Put the CIDR range. 

NOTE: `Master authorized networks` - This will restrict all external traffic to access GKE master through `https` except traffic from the specific CIDR block.
